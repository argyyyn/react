# Project description

The project was created as sandbox project for myself. The project uses old react class component
styles and react patterns as: 
1. using functions
2. render functions 
3. elements props
4. children 
5. refactor code
6. cloning elements
7. HOC 
8. context
9. context api

## Project goal

1. To create a react application using old style to understand all react history with old concepts
2. Adding all hooks to make development more effective (precommit, postcommit, husky...)
3. Repeating all testing practices (unit test, cypress...)
4. Use all design patterns in the project, as a self practice

## Known issues

1. Because of the creation of the project recently (1 month ago), the project was not finished
yet.
2. Before building the project and run it on prod env, the project throws error on clicking 
"throw error button". Success scenario: the project has to block the error on component level without breaking
the website. But the issue is expected because of eslint which shows us the error on screen.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### `npm run format`

Formats all files in directory "src" using standards of file ".prettierrc"
